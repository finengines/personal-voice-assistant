# Time Tool Fix - 2025 Year Issue

## Problem
The internal time tool was giving the wrong year (2024 instead of 2025) to the agent. This was causing confusion when users asked about the current time or date.

## Root Cause
The time tools were using `datetime.now()` without proper timezone handling, which could lead to inconsistent results depending on the system's local timezone configuration.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Time Tools
**File**: `personal_agent/backend/core/dynamic_agent.py`

#### `get_current_time()` Improvements:
- **Default to London timezone**: Now defaults to `Europe/London` when no specific timezone is provided
- **Enhanced location mapping**: Added UK/Britain aliases for better location recognition
- **Better error handling**: Added fallback mechanisms if timezone operations fail
- **Improved logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging timezone issues

#### `get_current_date()` Improvements:
- **Consistent timezone usage**: Now uses London timezone by default for consistency
- **Fallback mechanism**: Falls back to system time if timezone operations fail

#### `get_day_of_week()` Improvements:
- **Timezone-aware calculations**: Uses London timezone for "today" calculations
- **Enhanced date parsing**: Better handling of various date formats
- **Updated examples**: Changed example dates from 2024 to 2025

#### New `get_current_year()` Tool:
- **Dedicated year tool**: Added specific tool to get current year for debugging
- **Consistent timezone**: Uses London timezone for consistency

### 2. Docker Configuration Updates
**Files**: 
- `personal_agent/backend/Dockerfile`
- `personal_agent/docker-compose.yml`
- `personal_agent/docker-compose.prod.yml`

#### Environment Variable:
- **Added `TZ=Europe/London`**: Ensures consistent timezone in containerized environments

### 3. Enhanced Help Text
**File**: `personal_agent/backend/core/dynamic_agent.py`

#### Updated `help_with_tools()`:
- **Clarified timezone defaults**: Indicates that time tools default to London timezone
- **Added year tool**: Includes the new `get_current_year` tool in help text
- **Updated examples**: Added example for asking about the current year

## Testing

### Verification Steps:
1. **Local testing**: Confirmed tools return correct 2025 year
2. **Timezone testing**: Verified London timezone is used by default
3. **Error handling**: Tested fallback mechanisms work correctly
4. **Docker testing**: Ensured timezone environment variable is set

### Test Results:
```
üïê Testing Time Tools
==================================================

1. Testing London timezone:
London time: 04:45 PM on Sunday, July 27, 2025 BST

2. Testing current year:
Current year: 2025

3. Testing current date:
Current date: Sunday, July 27, 2025

4. Testing day of week:
Today is: Sunday

‚úÖ Time tools test completed
```

## Benefits

### 1. Consistency
- All time tools now use the same timezone (London) by default
- Eliminates confusion from different timezone interpretations

### 2. Reliability
- Enhanced error handling prevents tool failures
- Fallback mechanisms ensure tools always return useful information

### 3. Debugging
- New `get_current_year` tool helps identify time-related issues
- Better logging for troubleshooting timezone problems

### 4. User Experience
- Clear indication that tools default to London timezone
- Updated help text with accurate examples
- More intuitive location recognition (UK, Britain, England)

## Usage Examples

### Before (Problematic):
```
User: "What time is it?"
Agent: "The current local time is 4:45 PM on Sunday, July 27, 2024." ‚ùå
```

### After (Fixed):
```
User: "What time is it?"
Agent: "The current time in Europe/London is 4:45 PM on Sunday, July 27, 2025 BST." ‚úÖ

User: "What year is it?"
Agent: "The current year is 2025." ‚úÖ

User: "What time is it in London?"
Agent: "The current time in London is 4:45 PM on Sunday, July 27, 2025 BST." ‚úÖ
```

## Future Considerations

1. **User timezone preference**: Could add user-specific timezone settings
2. **Automatic timezone detection**: Could detect user's timezone from browser/system
3. **More location aliases**: Could expand location mapping for more cities/countries
4. **Time format preferences**: Could add user preferences for 12/24 hour format

## Files Modified

1. `personal_agent/backend/core/dynamic_agent.py` - Enhanced time tools
2. `personal_agent/backend/Dockerfile` - Added timezone environment variable
3. `personal_agent/docker-compose.yml` - Added timezone environment variable
4. `personal_agent/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Added timezone environment variable
5. `personal_agent/docs/TIME_TOOL_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Start the agent**: `docker-compose up -d`
2. **Ask about time**: "What time is it?"
3. **Ask about year**: "What year is it?"
4. **Check logs**: Verify no timezone-related errors in backend logs

The agent should now consistently return 2025 and use London timezone by default.
