## 🛠️ Latest Fix Summary

**Issue:** Agent presets were not loading due to connection reset errors on port 8083  
**Cause:** Preset API server was failing to start due to strict database connection requirements  
**Solution:** Added graceful error handling to allow the API to start even when database is unavailable, returning appropriate fallback responses  
**Result:** ✅ All preset functionality now works correctly with 4 default presets available

---

**🆕 Issue:** MCP server management returning 500 Internal Server Error when trying to load/add servers  
**Cause:** Missing `await` keywords for async methods in the MCP API endpoints (`get_server_status()`, `load_config()`)  
**Solution:** Fixed async/await inconsistencies in multiple endpoints:
- Fixed `get_mcp_manager()` dependency to await `load_config()`
- Fixed `/servers` endpoint to await `get_server_status()`  
- Fixed `/servers/{server_id}` endpoint to await `get_server_status()`
- Fixed `/servers/{server_id}/status` endpoint to await `get_server_status()`

**Result:** ✅ All MCP server management functionality now works correctly:
- ✅ Server listing displays existing servers
- ✅ Server creation/addition works properly  
- ✅ Individual server retrieval works
- ✅ Server status checking works
- ✅ Servers persist and are visible in the frontend UI

---

**🆕 Issue:** Frontend operations failing with "undefined" server IDs causing 404/422 errors  
**Cause:** React components using `server.id` instead of `server.server_id` from API response  
**Solution:** Fixed field name inconsistencies throughout frontend:
- Updated MCPManagement.jsx to use `server.server_id` for all operations (edit, delete, toggle)
- Updated AgentPresets.jsx to use `server.server_id` for MCP server selection
- Added missing `/servers/{server_id}/toggle` endpoint to backend API
- Rebuilt and redeployed frontend with corrected field references

**Result:** ✅ All frontend MCP server operations now work correctly:
- ✅ Server editing works with proper ID references
- ✅ Server deletion uses correct server IDs  
- ✅ Server enable/disable toggle functionality operational
- ✅ No more "undefined" server ID errors in browser console
- ✅ Agent presets can properly select MCP servers

---

**🆕 Issue:** Server edit operations failing with 422 errors when updating authentication tokens  
**Cause:** Frontend `startEdit` function only using partial server data from list endpoint, missing required fields  
**Solution:** Modified `startEdit` to fetch complete server configuration:
- Changed `startEdit` to async function that fetches full server details via `/servers/{id}` endpoint
- Ensures all required fields (id, name, description, server_type, etc.) are available for updates
- Properly maps full configuration data including authentication settings for editing
- Maintains field consistency between API response structure and frontend state

**Result:** ✅ Server authentication updates now work perfectly:
- ✅ Bearer token updates save successfully without 422 errors
- ✅ All authentication types (bearer, API key, basic, custom headers) fully editable
- ✅ Complete server configuration loaded for editing with all required fields
- ✅ No more "Unprocessable Entity" errors during server updates
- ✅ Authentication credentials persist correctly in database 

---

**🆕 Issue:** MCP tool execution timing out after 5 seconds causing "internal error" responses  
**Cause:** Default `client_session_timeout_seconds` in MCP client library was only 5 seconds, too short for slower external services  
**Solution:** Increased MCP timeout configurations:
- `client_session_timeout_seconds`: 60.0 (was 5.0) - Time allowed for tool calls to complete
- `timeout`: 30.0 (was 10.0) - HTTP connection timeout
- `sse_read_timeout`: 120.0 (was 60.0) - SSE read timeout for long operations
**Result:** ✅ MCP tools now have sufficient time to complete operations before timing out, resolving "internal error" responses when MCP servers are correctly executing but taking longer than 5 seconds to respond 

---

**🆕 Issue:** Voice agent conversation getting cut off and jarring interruptions due to poor turn detection  
**Cause:** Missing advanced turn detection, no noise cancellation, and default VAD settings not optimized for robust voice interaction  
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive voice interaction improvements:
- **Background Voice Cancellation (BVC)**: Integrated noise_cancellation.BVC() to filter background noise and multiple speakers
- **Optimized VAD Settings**: Configured Silero VAD with proper activation_threshold (0.5), min_speech_duration (0.2s), and min_silence_duration (0.5s)
- **Enhanced Interruption Handling**: Set min_interruption_duration (0.3s) to prevent noise triggers
- **Smart Endpointing Delays**: Configured min_endpointing_delay (0.4s) for faster response and max_endpointing_delay (3.0s) for complex thoughts
- **VAD-Based Turn Detection**: Using turn_detection="vad" for reliable operation (MultilingualModel requires additional model downloads)
- **Dependencies**: Added livekit-plugins-turn-detector and livekit-plugins-noise-cancellation packages  
**Result:** ✅ Voice agent now provides much more robust conversation experience:
- ✅ Significantly reduced unwanted interruptions and cut-offs
- ✅ Better noise handling prevents false voice activity triggers
- ✅ Reliable VAD-based turn detection works consistently in Docker environments
- ✅ Faster response times while maintaining conversation quality
- ✅ Enhanced audio quality with background voice cancellation
- ✅ Agent responds properly instead of being silent
- ✅ No more model file download errors causing agent crashes

---

**🆕 Issue:** Agent was completely silent and not responding to user input  
**Cause:** MultilingualModel() turn detection was failing due to missing model files that weren't downloaded during Docker build  
**Solution:** Switched to VAD-based turn detection (turn_detection="vad") which is more reliable for containerized deployments and doesn't require additional model downloads  
**Result:** ✅ Agent now responds correctly and conversation works as expected
